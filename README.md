This is a fullstack web application I developed to log climbs I've been on and to display weather and route information from mountain project.com.  I use my own API I created with Dotnet and two outside API's in this project.

Log climb page: This page is where you can input climbing information from a recent trip into the SQL database.

Browse Climbs:  This page allows you to manage and view the climbs that you have entered into the SQL database.

Weather Data page: Displays the weather data for a specific zip code and the routes that can be found nearby.  There are several favorite buttons available.

Todo List page: this page displays climbs that I have on my to do list on mountain project.
